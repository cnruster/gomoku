A simple Gomoku game in C, Win32

Gomoku is a board game widely played in Japan, China, and other countries. This project is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and in C. It is purely based on raw Win32 API. An AI engine is still missing and I hope to have one in the near future.

Basically it can now be used as a teaching aid for students who want to learning Win32 programming.
